# CKAN definition

The **martiLQ** has used similar terms and structures that are found in the 
CKAN API describing the resources.  This similarity allows for simple mapping of values
from the CKAN format to **martiLQ** format.

What **martiLQ** extends above the CKAN definition is attributes that can be
used to reconcile with the received data, plus the ability to define 
compressed and encrypted resources.

For more information on CKAN see https://ckan.org/
