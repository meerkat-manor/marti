# When would you use martiLQ

You are likely to start using the **martiLQ** framework when:
1. you have no existing standard or framework or;
2. your existing standards no longer meets you needs or;
3. you are starting document exchange with another business or division that uses the framework or;
4. there is a benefit to further automating your document processing in regard to audit and reconciliation

If you already have a standard and it works for you, and you have no upcoming (large)
initiative that would benefit from the framework, then stick with what you have.  The benefits
of the framework are unlikely to weigh in your framework

## Read the material

Please read the material before jumping in and make sure the **martiLQ** framework will
provide you with the expected benefits.  Implementing the framework and then changing 
your direction will more than likely add to your support costs.

**Note**: As the framework is based on open structure and can be processed independently 
without the tools, you can export the definitions to other tools / future methods.
