MartiLQ objective
=================

The objective of **martLQ** is to define a simle standard for
capturing the data files being transferred.  It is not for 
real time web service transactions.  

**martiLQ** is about file and document transfer and reconciling
that the all files have arrived and have not changed, and if so
required are also encrypted.

The proposition is to have a common, machine readable format
for file exchange that:

  * ensures data load quality and reconciles
  * can be used on Linux or Windows or Mac
  * can be used with Python, Java, PowerShell, Golang, etc 
  * can be used by web services
  * uses a text based format (JSON)
  * can form part of the data processing pipeline

And finally is easy to understand.
