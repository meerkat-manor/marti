# Golang

There is a working prototype of the **martiLQ** framework in Go.

Check out the source code under [client](client/)

The prototype is able to:

 * Initialise by creating a config file
 * Create a JSON **martiLQ** definition file based on files in a directory

__TO COME__

Publish of Golan package is yet to occur. A binary executable will also be
published for Linux and Windows of the prototype. 

This will occur after merge of code into ``main`` branch.
