The custome definition section allows the inclusion of extensions
to the standard.  To demonstrate the inclusion, there are three
sample extensions.  These are:

  * Software - describing the **martiLQ** software version
  * Spatial - Defining the geographical boundary of the documents
  * Temporal - Defining date and time aspects of the documents
