**marti** stands for metadata reconcilation for transfer information.

Before starting with **marti** it is advisable to understand if it is right for
your organisation's needs.  Information is available in a number of short 
documents.

There is no quickstart document to get you started as each use case and
organisation is different. There are sample implementations which you
can adjust if they resonate with your circumstances,
 see [sample implementations](samples/)
