# What is marti

The foundation pillar for the **marti** framework is the [marti document](../marti.md) 
that defines the reconciliation and other metadata of the document / file being transferred.

A definition, while fundamental, benefits from having tools that can create, read and 
interpret the definition.  The **marti** framework is about providing those tools
and a ecosystem that can be added to.

The majority of the effort in creating **marti** is in the tools.  There are tools
for various programming languages and situations.  As many programming languages
generate portable programs that can execute on multiple operating systems, the
likelihood is that a tools exists for you.

The source for tools is provided in this repository and some have precompiled
images.

See the [source](../source/) directory for more details.
